This pseudo documentation to think through how a _opmlfind_ might work. It is inspired by Unix _find_ command. Should also consider how [jq](https://github.com/stedolan/jq) and [jid](https://github.com/simeji/jid) work with JSON data.

# OPMLFIND

# NAME
     opmlfind -- walk a an OPML outline

# SYNOPSIS
     find [-L | -P] [-EXdsx] [-f path...]
     find [-L | -P] [-EXdsx] -f path] [path...] [expression]

# DESCRIPTION

The opmlfind utility recursively descends the outline for each OPML file
listed, evaluating an _expression_ (composed of the ``primaries'' and
``operands'' listed below) in terms of each outline.

The options are as follows:

     -E    Interpret regular expressions followed by --regex and --iregex pri-
           maries as extended (modern) regular expressions rather than basic
           regular expressions (BRE's).  The re_format(7) manual page fully
           describes both formats.

     -L    Cause the outline information and outline element type return.

     -d    Cause opmlfind to perform a depth-first traversal, i.e., outlines
           are visited in post-order and all entries in a outline will be
           acted on before the outline itself.  By default, opmlfind visits
           outlines in pre-order, i.e., before their contents.  Note, the
           default is not a breadth-first traversal.

     -f    Specify a outline hierarchy for opmlfind to traverse.  Outline hierarchies
           may also be specified as the operands immediately following the
           options.

     -s    Cause opmlfind to traverse the outline hierarchies in lexicographical
           order, i.e., alphabetical order within each directory.  Note:
           `opmlfind -s' and `opmlfind | opmlsort' may give different results.

# PRIMARIES

All primaries which take a numeric argument allow the number to be pre-
ceded by a plus sign (``+'') or a minus sign (``-'').  A preceding plus
sign means ``more than n'', a preceding minus sign means ``less than n''
and neither means ``exactly n''.

     -Bmin n
             True if the difference between the time of a outline nodes's cre-
             ation and the time opmlfind was started, rounded up to the next full
             minute, is n minutes.

     -Btime n[smhdw]
             If no units are specified, this primary evaluates to true if the
             difference between the time of an outline node creation and the
             time opmlfind was started, rounded up to the next full 24-hour
             period, is _n 24-hour periods.

             If units are specified, this primary evaluates to true if the
             difference between the time of a outline node's creation and the
             time opmlfind was started is exactly n units.  The
             supported time units.

             ss       second
             mm       minute (60 seconds)
             hh       hour (60 minutes)
             dd       day (24 hours)
             ww       week (7 days)

             Any number of units may be combined in one -Btime argument, for
             example, ``-Btime -1h30m''.  Units are probably only useful when
             used in conjunction with the ++ or -- modifier.

     -d      Same as depth. 

     -depth  Always true; same as the -d option.

     -depth n
             True if the depth of the outline node relative to the starting point of
             the traversal is n.

     -empty  True if the current outline node is empty.

     -iname pattern
             Like -name, but the match is case insensitive.

     -ipath pattern
             Like -path, but the match is case insensitive.

     -iregex pattern
             Like -regex, but the match is case insensitive.

     -maxdepth n
             Always true; descend at most n outline levels below the command
             root.  If any -maxdepth primary is specified, it
             applies to the entire expression even if it would not normally be
             evaluated.  ``-maxdepth 0'' limits the whole search to the com-
             mand line arguments.

     -mindepth n
             Always true; do not apply any tests or actions at levels less
             than n.  If any -mindepth primary is specified, it applies to the
             entire expression even if it would not normally be evaluated.
             ``-mindepth 1'' processes all but the command line arguments.

     -name pattern
             True if the last component of the outline node being examined matches
             pattern.  Special shell pattern matching characters (``['',
             ``]'', ``*'', and ``?'') may be used as part of pattern.  These
             characters may be matched explicitly by escaping them with a
             backslash (``\'').

     -prune  This primary always evaluates to true.  It causes opmlfind to not
             descend into the current outline node.  Note, the -prune primary has no
             effect if the -d option was specified.

     -regex pattern
             True if the whole path of the outline node matches pattern using regular
             expression.  

     -type t
             True if the opml outline node is of the specified type.  Possible types
             are as follows:

             rss    link it to an RSS resource
             text   treat the outline node as plain text
             ...


ENVIRONMENT

The LANG, LC_ALL, LC_COLLATE, LC_CTYPE, LC_MESSAGES and LC_TIME environ-
ment variables affect the execution of the ffiinndd utility as described in
environ(7).

EXAMPLES

The following examples are shown as given to the shell:
